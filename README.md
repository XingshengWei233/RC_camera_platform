# RC_camera_platform
## Objective:
Design and make a prototype of a vehicle to carry a camera or a phone which is remote controllable with a game controller, for video makers to use.
## Next Steps to Take:
1. Improve the design and controller to get smoother movement and reduce vibration.
2. Integrate stabilizing structure into the vehicle to hold the camera more steady.
